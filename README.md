I have compiled a list of NPM libraries that can be used to develop small and large-scale applications with Next.js. The list is based on my personal experience as a front-end developer, and I have used 80% of the packages mentioned. As I discover more packages in the future, I will add them to the current list to help other front-end developers build applications with Next.js more efficiently.

To stay updated, please follow us on GitHub and give our repository a star. This will help others discover our repository, encouraging more developers to contribute and build a solid list. Additionally, we encourage you to share our repository on your social media platforms, like X (previously known as Twitter).
